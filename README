Facedancer Client Scripts 
by brad.antoniewicz@foundstone.com
---------------------------------------------------


I use this scripts pretty regularly when working with
the facedancer. They're provided as-is but should
work with minimal modification. 

goodfet.maxusb_template -
    (Requires ordereddict.py)
    This is templated goodfet.maxusb client to be modified
    immediately for your project. It break things up a little
    neater and [for me] makes it easier to get things done
    faster. Make sure you modify the do_IN4() appropriately,
    that will be the meat of client. You can change the name
    to more appropriately fit your scenario.


createStringsFromVMWareLog.py - 
    This script parses a VMWare.log file and produces
    "strings" files. When trying to recreate the communication
    between an endpoint and a host, there are often huge
    packets sent back and forth. This scripts eases that 
    process to a certain extent. At the end of the day
    its up to you to include the file as part of your 
    gootfet.maxusb client. Right now this really just
    supports one active endpoint. :/
